CSE,150,"Foundations of Computer Science: Honors","Introduction to the logical and mathematical foundations of computer science for computer science honors students. Topics include functions, relations, and sets; recursion and functional programming; basic logic; and mathematical induction and other proof techniques.",,,4
CSE/ISE,312,"Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing","This course deals with the impact of computers on us as individuals and on our society. Rapid changes in computing technology and in our use of that technology have changed the ways we work, play, and interact with other people. These changes have created a flood of new social, legal and ethical issues that demand critical examination. This course is offered as both CSE 312 and ISE 312.",,CER/ESI/STAS,3
CSE,320,"Systems Fundamentals II","This course introduces essential concepts of operating systems, compilers, concurrency, and performance analysis, focused around several cross-cutting examples, such as memory management, error handling, and threaded programming. In this course, operating systems concepts are considered from the point of view of the application programmer, and the focus is on APIs for interacting with an operating system. A companion course, CSE 306, considers operating systems from the point of view of the OS kernel implementer.",,,3
CSE,316,"Funadmentals of Software Development","Introduction to systematic design, development and testing of software systems, including event-driven programming, information management, databases, principles and practices for secure computing, and version control. Students apply these skills in the construction of large, robust programs.",,ESI/EXP+/SBS+/STEM+,3
